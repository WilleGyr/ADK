This exercise required testing the sorting algorithms written in Exercise 1 in the following cases:
* Using the array A = [3, 1, 5, 10, 8, 7, 5, 2, 9, 6, 1, 2]
* Using my personal number (last 4 number switched) = [2, 0, 0, 4, 0, 5, 0, 8, 1, 2, 3, 4]

While it is a less clean solution code-wise, 6 arrays were created (3 of each array or 2 for each algorithm) to remove the risk of affecting the arrays between the different sorting algorithms

The main function creates arrays A1-6, calls the sorting algorithms using the imported A2_Ex1.h file and prints the sorted arrays 

This code acts as test cases for A2_Ex1.c

The code is implemented in the following file:
    - A2_Ex3.c

Code Execution:
To compile and execute the code:
    $ gcc -c A2_Ex1.c
    $ gcc -c A2_Ex3.c
    $ gcc A2_Ex1.o A2_Ex3.o -o A2_Ex3
    $ ./A2_Ex3
