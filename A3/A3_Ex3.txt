This exercise asked to test the previous exercises.

1.
Load two problem files into arrays. One with the size of 1000 and one with the size of 100000.
Used the load_file function.

2.
Constructed a BST for each array.

3.
Printed the BSTs in sorted order using the inorderTreeWalk function.
Then compared them with the solution files to make sure it was correct.

4.
Calculated the balance factor for each BST using the algorithms from exercise 2.
The BST of size 1000 had a balance factor of 5.
The BST of size 100000 had a balance factor of 15.
The BST of size 1000 was somehow-balanced while the BST of size 100000 was imbalanced.

The code is implemented in the following file:
    - A3_Ex3.c
    - load_file.c
    - load_file.h
    - tree.c
    - tree.h

Code Execution:
To compile and execute the code:
    $ gcc -c A3_Ex3.c
    $ gcc -c load_file.c
    $ gcc -c tree.c
    $ gcc -o A3_Ex3 A3_Ex2.o tree.o load_file.o
    $ ./A3_Ex3
